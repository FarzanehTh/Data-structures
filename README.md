# Some Data structures coded in Python:


**BFS.py ** contains the BFS  implementation  : BFS ,among all other applications, can be used to find shortest path between two vertices in a graph.

** DFS ** contains the DFS implementation : DFS can be used to determine if there exits a cycle in the graph , also it is used for Topological Sort as well.

** LL.py** Contains the Linked List implementation
